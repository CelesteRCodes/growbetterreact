7/24:  
    Cards showing up on homepage under login, should not show 
    until user has logged in
        - need to use conditional rendering (will watch YT tutorials)

    make UserPlants a page of Card components for each plant
        - can show a carousel of plant images added by user 
          (later sprint)
        - later sprint, auto create new card for each plant added 
          by user

    need to make a database to hold users, plants, and plant logs

    need to make functions to create new cards for new plants added

    plant log can be a table for now, will want to find another way
    to display entries
        - want to add a delete button to each entry and edit option
        - table currently not responsive with diff screen sizes;
          table should break and stack

    MVP:
        be able to see function login on home page only
            - logs in and logs out

        registration page shows for to register new user
            - buttons to submit new user or cancel/go back to home
        
        once logged in, shows a card of user's plant 
        (hardcode for now)
            - buttons to log out/go back to home, to plant 
              details for each card, plant log for each card, 
              and grow log (for admin)
            - show image of plant (hardcoded)
            - possibly show a dropdown of options for each plant
              (edit plant log, delete plant log, delete plant,
              send plant to graveyard, rename plant)

        plant details page shows details of specfic plant
            - buttons to add new entry to plant log, to show plant log,
              to go back to show user plants, to log out
        
        plant log shows table of plant log entries (hardcode one entry)
            - buttons to add new entry, to go back to show user plants,
              to log out

        admin grow log, shows all entries into database (not created yet)
            - buttons to go back to show user plants, and to log out
            - display a button on each entry to delete entry (doesn't 
              have to be functional yet)
              
              
  RESOLVED:
    - Card.js img not showing up on Card (RESOLVED - 7/25)
